Step 1: Install Git
Update your package index:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
git --version
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --list


Generate SSH Key (Optional but Recommended)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Copy your SSH key to your clipboard:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Add your SSH key to your GitHub account:

Go to GitHub SSH and GPG keys settings.
Click New SSH key.
Add a title and paste the SSH key into the key field.
Click Add SSH key.

Step 4: Clone a Repository from GitHub
Choose the repository you want to clone:
Navigate to the repository on GitHub that you want to clone.
Copy the repository URL:
If you're using SSH, it will look something like this: git@github.com:username/repo-name.git.
If you're using HTTPS, it will look like this: https://github.com/username/repo-name.git.

git clone git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
or git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

cd repo-name

Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository (if not already initialized)
If you haven't already initialized a Git repository in your project directory, you can do so with the following command:

git init

Step 2: Add the File to the Repository
First, add the file you want to commit to the staging area. For example, if your file is named example.txt:

git add example.txt

You can also add all files in the directory by using:

git add .

Step 3: Commit the File
Next, commit the file with a commit message. The commit message should briefly describe the changes you made. For example:

git commit -m "Add example.txt with initial content"

Checking the Status
To see the status of your repository and check which files are staged for commit, you can use:

git status

Viewing the Commit History
To view the commit history, use:

git log

Add the Remote Repository
Add the GitHub repository as a remote in your local Git repository. Replace your_username and your_repository with your GitHub username and repository name, respectively:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git

If you prefer to use SSH instead of HTTPS, use:

git remote add origin git@github.com:your_username/your_repository.git

Step 3: Push the Commit to GitHub
Push your commits to the main branch on GitHub:

git push -u origin main
